# Artificial Intelligence

This is a Treasure Hunt Maze that uses an Artificial Intelligent agent as part of an assignment for a Current Trends Course at SNHU. The code for the game play was provided in my course materials. The Q Learning algorithm was written by myself. It can be found in the Carter_Joann_ProjectTwo.ipynb file.

During this course I learned a lot about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Algorithms. Most importantly, I learned about the ethical decisions that need to be made by computer scientists. Subjects like: unbiased data, designing for ethical purposes, and including a well rounded or diverse group into the planning/review stages were all topics of importance. <b>Maintaining a solid ethical foundation is something I am passionate about.</b>
